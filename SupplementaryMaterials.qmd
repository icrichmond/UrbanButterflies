This supplementary information file contains (1) variable descriptions, (2) descriptive statistics for each study site, (3) summary tables of each model, (4) an abundance histogram of all species found, (5) a figure showing the interaction effect of niche breadth for butterfly abundance as explained by number of native flowering species. All associated code can be found at the paper's associated GitHub repository, [here](https://github.com/icrichmond/UrbanButterflies).

## Variables

**Table S1.** Variable names, acronym (used in R code), and descriptions.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| label: variables

var <- read.csv("input/variables.csv")

knitr::kable(var)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Descriptive Statistics

**Table S2.** Descriptive statistics of butterfly abundance, species richness, and Shannon diversity, and plant species richness and % bloom for all flowering plants and native flowering plants. Variable acronyms/shortforms can be found in Table S1.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| label: descriptive-stats

plant <- read.csv("output/PlantCleanbySite.csv")
plant <- plant %>% 
  select(nspecies, nnative, avgbloom, avgnatbloom)

butt <- read.csv("output/ButterflyCleanbySite.csv")
butt <- butt %>% 
  select(SWP, abund, SpeciesRichness, Shannon) %>%
  rename(Abund = abund,
         Richness = SpeciesRichness)

df <- cbind(butt, plant)

knitr::kable(df, digits = 2)
```

## Species Abundance

![](figures/AbundanceHistogram.png)

Figure S1. Raw abundance counts for each species identified and counted for this study. If a species level identification was not possible, we used genus level. If a genus level identification was not possible, we used family.

Figure S2. Native plant community models showing the the interaction between number of native flowering species and niche breadth. IRR = 1.06 +/ 1.03, p-value = 0.02, R2 = 0.69. Here we are reporting the IRR value from the interaction where the value represents the effect size of the wetland specialist group interacting with number of native flowering species and average native bloom cover compared to the effect size of the generalist group. Points are raw data from individual stormwater pond sites. Plots made using the marginaleffects package and ggplot2 (Arel-Bundock et al., 2024; Wickham et al., 2016).

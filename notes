now have three hypotheses: 

urbanization affects abundance/sh/sr

total plant presence affects abundance/sh/sr

native plant presence affects abundance/sh/sr


abundance is mixed models w niche breadth (no p-values yet) 

shannon diversity and species richness have significant relationships w urbanization 

no sig relationships between shan div and sr wrt plants (possible that we did not observe enough variation in availability -> management implication)

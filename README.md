## Abstract
1. Stormwater ponds are constructed to mitigate flooding but have the potential to serve as important habitats for pollinators in cities. 
2. We tested whether stormwater ponds were used by butterflies and the determinants of butterfly biodiversity in such systems. We studied the impact of surrounding urban land cover and floral resources on butterfly communities at 21 stormwater ponds across a large metropolitan area. 
3. We found that stormwater ponds supported a diversity of butterfly species, including four wetland specialist’s species. Surrounding urbanization had an overall negative impact on butterfly communities at ponds while increasing floral resources supported higher species richness and abundance of butterflies. Wetland specialists’ butterflies responded similarly as habitat generalists to urbanization and floral resources but with an emphasis on the importance of native plants for supporting larger wetland specialists’ populations at ponds. 
4. Intentional design and placement of stormwater ponds within the urban landscape to support pollinators will enhance their ecological services.

## Model descriptions  
Due to correlations between several of our explanatory variables, we opted to create three models that tested separate hypotheses: disturbance model, native plant model, and total plant model. Dependent variables include abundance, species richness, and Shannon diversity. Species richness and Shannon diversity were rarified using the `iNEXT` package to account for differences in sampling effort across sites.  

The disturbance model includes a binary variable of disturbed/undisturbed, measured by Jesse in the field and is based on % mowed with sites that have over approximately 30% mowed marked as disturbed. We also created buffers around each site and calculated the % area that is anthropogenic in each buffer (anthropogenic defined as settlement or roads). Eight buffer distances were tested: 20 m, 50 m, 100 m, 200 m, 500 m, 1000 m, 2000 m, and 5000 m based on Rivest & Kharouba (2021, *Canadian Journal of Zoology*) and Kuussaari et al. (2021, *Urban Ecosystems*).  

The native plants model includes number of native species found at each site and average cover of native plant bloom in each quadrat at each site. The total plant model used the same measures but included all flowering plants observed at each site.  

Below represents the general code used for each model: 
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
# disturbance model
dist <- lm(response ~ Disturbance * anthroper, data = df)
# native species model 
nat <- lm(response ~ nnative * avgnatbloom, data = df)
# full species model 
full <- lm(response ~ nspecies * avgbloom, data = df)
# null 
null <- lm(response ~ 1, data = x)
```

## Buffer Distances
To test which buffer distance performed best, we took the top performing model (disturbance for all) for each response variable and did AICc model ranking at each buffer distance. Species richness and Shannon diversity were best explained at similar scales, around 1 km. Abundance had top-ranking models with much smaller buffer distances.   
**NOTE:** delta AICc <2 are best performing models, with anything within  ~2.18 delta AICc of each other performing the same (statistically indistinguishable).  

**Table 1.** AICc table of buffer distances for abundance models. All models compared are disturbance models, as disturbance was the top ranking model for abundance. Numbers in model name refer to the buffer distance (i.e., Modnames = AbDist50 = abundance disturbance model at 50 m buffer distance)
```{r, echo = F, eval=T}
a <- readRDS("/home/icrichmond/Repositories/urban-butterflies/large/AbundanceBufferAIC.rds")

knitr::kable(a) 
```

**Table 2.** AICc table of buffer distances for species richness models. All models compared are disturbance models, as disturbance was the top ranking model for species richness Numbers in model name refer to the buffer distance (i.e., Modnames = SRDist1000 = species richness disturbance model at 1000 m buffer distance)
```{r, echo = F, eval=T}
sr <- readRDS("/home/icrichmond/Repositories/urban-butterflies/large/SpeciesRichnessBufferAIC.rds")

knitr::kable(sr) 
```

**Table 3.** AICc table of buffer distances for Shannon diversity models. All models compared are disturbance models, as disturbance was the top ranking model for Shannon diversity. Numbers in model name refer to the buffer distance (i.e., Modnames = ShDist1000 = Shannon diversity disturbance model at 1000 m buffer distance)
```{r, echo = F, eval=T}
sr <- readRDS("/home/icrichmond/Repositories/urban-butterflies/large/ShannonBufferAIC.rds")

knitr::kable(sr) 
```

## Top Model Summaries
We investigate the top models at each buffer distance to see which variables are driving these relationships. An important consideration is that our models are explaining a high amount of variation, even when there are not statistically significant relationships. One factor that I think may be driving this is that we do not actually see very much variation in our dataset which is an important consideration for when we write up the results we have found.

The next figure represents the R<sup> 2 </sup> for the top model at each buffer distance, with each line representing a different response variable. It's important to note that the top model was not always the disturbance model, however, for the top performing buffer distances, the top model was always disturbance.

## Take-aways
These are my main take-aways after looking at these results, but I am of course eager to get everyone else's inputs on these! 

- Top-ranked buffer distances are similar for species richness and Shannon diversity but very different for abundance
- Disturbance is the top model at each of the top-ranked buffer distances 
- Mowing Disturbed/Undisturbed category most important for abundance
- Percent anthropogenic land-use most important for species richness and Shannon diversity
